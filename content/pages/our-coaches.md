      For the Coaches page on your website, you can have a simple layout with a
      main section introducing your coaches and links or buttons that guide
      users to individual pages for each coach. Here's an idea for how the page
      could be structured:Page Title:Our CoachesSubtitle:Meet the Experts Behind
      Lago Academy's Success
    text: >-
      Start adding sections by clicking the + button on the page or through the
      sidebar.
